Hepworth Training:
This approach uses an out-of-fold prediction model. The best model was selected based on a five-fold cross-validation evaluation using the Hepworth Trial 1 Brewery dataset.

The model was trained on an interpolated daily dataset derived from the Hepworth dataset. The trained model has been added to this directory and is saved as 'best_model_fold_4.keras'.

Transfer Learning:
A cleaned version of the WASE Trial 2 dataset from the Cook site has also been included. This dataset has been refined to align with the key features identified in the feature importance analysis of the original Hepworth model.

The machine learning pipeline is designed to retrain the last two neurons of the Hepworth model using the Cook dataset.

Implementation Methodology:
Since the goal is to use this model as a soft sensor, the dataset has been split into two halves:
- The first half is used for training, and predictions are made on the second half.
- The process is then reversed, training on the second half and predicting on the first half.

To account for recalibration, 10 additional days from each split have been injected into the opposite partition.
